# Solar System

A website explaining the solar system.
<br>
## Why it was made

This project was made in 2015 for the end of one of my formations in web design.
The goal was to create a website with the possibility to choose the theme.
<br>
## How it was made

The website is made in plain HTML5 and CSS and is responsive.
The content comes from Wikipedia at the time of construction. It may have changed since then.
The inclusion of a music was a requirement but is not activated by default.
The website is hosted byÂ [Toile Libre](https://www.toile-libre.org/).
