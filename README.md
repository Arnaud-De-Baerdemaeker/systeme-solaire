# Solar System

A website explaining the solar system.
<br>
## Why it was made

This project was made in 2015 for the end of one of my formations in web design.<br>
The goal was to create a website with the possibility to choose the theme.
<br>
## How it was made

The website is made in plain HTML5 and CSS and is responsive.<br>
The content comes from Wikipedia at the time of construction. It may have changed since then.<br>
The inclusion of a music was a requirement but is not activated by default.<br>
The website is hosted by [Toile Libre](https://www.toile-libre.org/).
